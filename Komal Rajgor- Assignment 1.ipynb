Tuples are used when you want to keep data safe and constant. This immutability ensures data integrity and allows tuples to be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets whereas list can be modified in place without creating a new object. This makes lists highly flexible and efficient for operations like appending, slicing, or updating elements.\n","\n","Q7 What is the difference between == and is?\n","\n","-> == checks if values are equal (like comparing two identical objects), while is checks if both things are actually the same person (same memory location).\n","\n","Q8 What are logical operators in Python?\n","\n","-> Logical operators in Python help make decisions\n","\n","and: Both conditions must be true.\n","\n","or: At least one should be true.\n","\n","not: Reverses the condition.\n","\n","Q9 What is type casting in Python?\n","\n","-> Type casting is just converting one type into another, like turning a string \"11\" into an integer 11. It is useful when taking input from users.\n","\n","Q10 Difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","\n","-> Implicit:  The Python interpreter automatically converts one data type to another without user intervention it heppends when there is no risk of data loss\n","\n","Explicit: The programmer manually converts one data type to another using type conversion functions.\n","\n","Q11 What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","\n","-> Conditional statements like if, elif, and else help your program choose what to do based on the situation.\n","\n","if: Executes a block of code if the condition is True.\n","\n","elif: Adds additional conditions to check if the first condition is False.\n","\n","else: Executes a block of code if all previous conditions are False\n","\n","Q12 How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","-> The elif statement in Python is used as part of conditional statements to check multiple conditions sequentially. It allows you to test additional conditions if the previous ones are not true.\n","\n","Q13 What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","\n","-> For loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or range) with a known number of iterations. It's ideal when you know the collection or range beforehand.\n","\n","While loop is usedExecutes as long as a condition is True. It's better for scenarios where the number of iterations isn't predetermined"],"metadata":{"id":"pHE4t-xF_xUY"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"uurqOD4597Qc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749697103679,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":68,"user":{"displayName":"Komal Rajgor","userId":"09484348661689225347"}},"outputId":"0a1187b9-933c-43b3-c67e-6c30ac98c40b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, World!\n"]}],"source":[" # 1.
